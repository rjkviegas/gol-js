# Game of Life 
A zero player game using Node JS, tested using Jasmine.

## The Game 
The Game Of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Here's the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for more details.

## The Rules
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
